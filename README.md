This python script lists and opens the urls of the questions that are likely to be closed.

The idea is ,Newest Questions having large number of down votes are likely to be flagged.

This script eliminates the questions that are already flagged([on hold],[duplicate],[closed]).

Using this script you can easliy find the questions to be flagged and earn the marshal flag faster.

>You start with 10 flags per day.

>Based on your reputation and flagging history, you can end up with as many as 100 per day.

>Currently, that means you get an extra flag per day for every 2000 reputation points or 10 net helpful flags (helpful-declined).

>Since you  have an insane number of helpful flags, you're maxed out at 100 per day.

You can change the range of pages checked by modifying the code

This python script lists questions with  spelling mistakes in thier title.

You can edit the titles of those questions.

We use us-english dictionary  and a file with technical terms(tech-terms.txt) that is usually identified as spelling mistakes.

tech-terms.txt is not even nearly complete. Feel free to add words.

Only title is checked now, we can extend it to check content too.
